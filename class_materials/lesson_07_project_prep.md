# Prepping for the RPN Calculator Project

Now that you have been through the demo and seen, heard and in some cases, tried each of the steps, let's put it all together and get you set up to work on the RPN Calculator project.

The details of the Project will be described in the next lesson. This lesson is more about getting your working environment set up, AND giving you a summary of the major commands, etc.

These steps purposely limit the explanation to highlight the major commands and steps. If you need some review on a given command, feel free to ask the mentors in the room OR to refer back to the main lecture/demo materials. 

# Objectives

Through participating in this session, attendees will be able to:

* Prep their environment:  do all the preliminary steps necessary to:
    * setup a virtual environment specific to this project
    * activate the virtualenv
    * install the software required for the project in the virtualenv
    * fork the project to your Github repo
    * clone the project to your local directory
* Review the major steps performed when making changes
* Review the major steps when issuing a Pull Request

# Hands-on

## Make your virtual environment

The following steps will set up your system in preparation for the remaining lessons:

Follow the directions below, depending on your operating system.

### Linux\Mac OSX version

1. `conda create -n rpncalc python=3`
1. `source activate rpncalc`
1. `conda install ipython`

### Windows version
