## Overview

With larger projects, it is very common to create **branches** and then **merge** the branches into the main project when you make changes. You've seen references to `master` above, the default branch. A typical enhancement would be done by:

1. creating a branch (so you have a separate workspace to work in) using `git checkout -b <branch name>`
1. doing your work as a series of `git add`, `git commit` cycles to the branch
1. merging your changes back into `master`
1. submitting a pull request to the project owner (covered in a separate discussion)

By following this pattern, you keep your work isolated from the rest of the project until it is ready to be released. Examples include:

* creating new features
* experimenting with changes to the code
* fixing bugs

Branches should be small and self-contained so that they can be merged. Sprawling and convoluted changes to code can make it nearly impossible to merge. In addition, it is customary for branches to be focused on specific problems: i.e. one bug fix per branch OR one new feature per branch.

## What to do

A typical iteration of creating a feature (sometimes called a `feature branch`) would look like this:

```bash
$ git checkout -b my-feature-name     # "-b" creates a new branch named "my-feature-branch"
```

... **do some work/make some changes** in my editor or IDE ... ie, change the 23rd line "jabberwocky.txt".

```
$ git add jabberwocky.txt
$ git commit -m 'my first bit of work'
```

... **do some more work** in my editor or IDE ...

```
$ git add jabberwocky.txt
$ git commit -m 'my second bit of work'
```

Once we are done, let's merge the feature branch back into the master branch

```
$ git checkout master     # this checks out the master branch   
$ git pull                # this pulls any remote changes into master           
$ git merge my-feature-name
$ git push origin master
$ git branch -d my-feature-name
```

## The big picture

Let's imagine that you are working on a project with multiple commits to the master branch and a single bug fix branch to fix Issue #53 called `iss53`. Commits `C3` and `C5` are the changes that were committed on the branch, and `C4` is a change made by someone else to the master branch during that same timeframe.

The history created by the above steps would look something like this:

Following this workflow allows you to potentially work on multiple features or bugs and yet still maintain a clean, reliable and working set of code at all time.

## Deep dive

### Make a change in a branch

Besides `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, the next logical step is to grow familiar with using the branch-work-merge flow to isolate your work from changes made by others.

#### Create a branch

**Note:** replace "my\_change\_name" with the name of the feature you are adding.

```bash
$ git checkout -b my_change_name
```

#### Make your changes

When you are finished making changes, proceed with the remaining steps.

#### Commit your changes

```bash
$ git add johnny_appleseed.txt
$ git commit -m 'added my new feature'
```


#### Merge your changes into the master branch

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git merge my_change_name
```

If you have any conflicts, you will need to address them. GitHub has a simple resource for [resolving conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/). A full discussion of conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this lesson.

#### Delete your feature branch

When you are finished using a branch (i.e. all the pertinent changes have been merged into master), you can simply delete it:

```bash
$ git branch -d my_change_name
```
