## Overview

With larger projects, it is very common to create **branches** and then **merge** the branches into the main project when you make changes. You've seen references to `master` above, the default branch. A typical enhancement would be done by:

1. creating a branch (so you have a separate workspace to work in) using `git checkout -b <branch name>`
1. doing your work as a series of `git add`, `git commit` cycles to the branch
1. merging your changes back into `master`
1. submitting a pull request to the project owner (covered in a separate discussion)

By following this pattern, you keep your work isolated from the rest of the project until it is ready to be shared or incorporated. Examples include:

* creating new features
* experimenting with changes to the code
* fixing bugs

Branches should be small and self-contained so that they can be merged easily. Sprawling and convoluted changes to code can make it nearly impossible to merge changes. In addition, it is customary for branches to be focused on specific problems, i.e., one bug fix per branch OR one new feature per branch.

## What to do

A typical iteration of creating a feature (sometimes called a `feature branch`) would look like this:

**Create a new branch** & cause Git to begin tracking changes in that branch

```bash
$ git checkout -b appleseed-feature     # "-b" creates a new branch named "appleseed-feature"
```

**Do work/edit files**

In your editor or IDE ... change the 23rd line in the file "jabberwocky.txt".

**`git add`** changes to the staging area ...

```bash
$ git add jabberwocky.txt
$ git commit -m "my first bit of work"
```

**Continue editing if desired** ...

If you want, you can continue to make changes to the same file OR other files...

**`git add`** these new changes to the staging area ...

```bash
$ git add jabberwocky.txt
$ git commit -m "my second bit of work"
```

**Checkout the master branch** and prepare to merge all our changes with any other changes that have been accepted into the upstream codebase...

```bash
$ git checkout master            # this checks out the master branch
```

**Update our local copy** ... Before we try to merge our changes to master, let's update our local copy of the repo with any updates that might have occurred in the `upstream` version by using `git pull`.

```bash
$ git pull upstream master       # this pulls any upstream changes into your computer
```

**NOTE:** This is generally not necessary, but if *your* GitHub fork also has some changes not reflected in your local copy, you should update the local copy by pulling in those changes as well. How could this happen, you ask? If you directly edit content on your GitHub fork in the browser OR if you (via a separate account) or someone else have applied changes to your GitHub fork directly or via pull request.

```bash
$ git pull origin master         # Generally not necessary, but this pulls
                                 # any changes in *your* GitHub fork repo to your computer
```

**Merge local changes into our local copy of master** ... With the latest and greatest `upstream` (and/or `origin`) changes on your local machine, attempt to merge your branch into your local copy of `master`

```bash
$ git merge appleseed-feature
```

**`git push`** changes to our **GitHub repo** ... presuming a successful merge (don't worry will discuss what to do if the merge is not successful) you can now `git push` your changes to your **GitHub repo** (your changes do NOT go to upstream, yet...)

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

**Delete your unneeded branch** ... presuming a successful push, you can safely delete the branch:

```bash
$ git branch -d appleseed-feature
```

If you (and your partner, if you're working in pairs) are done, then you can put your green sticky up! This is how we know you're done.

## The big picture

Let's imagine that you are working on a project with multiple commits to the master branch and a single bug fix branch to fix Issue #53 called `iss53`. Commits `C3` and `C5` are the changes that were committed on the branch, and `C4` is a change made by someone else to the master branch during that same timeframe.

The history created by the above steps would look something like this:

Following this workflow allows you to potentially work on multiple features or bugs and yet still maintain a clean, reliable and working set of code at all times.

## Deep dive

### Make a change in a branch

Besides `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, the next logical step is to grow familiar with using the **branch-work-merge** flow to isolate your work from changes made by others.

#### Create a branch

**Note:** replace "appleseed-feature" with the name of the feature you are adding. The `git checkout` command allows you to change to a new branch. If that branch does not exist yet, it can be created with the `-b` option.

```bash
$ git checkout -b appleseed-feature
```

What makes a good branch name? What are the rules for naming branches? This is a short list of rules (for a complete list, see the [Git man pages](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-check-ref-format.html).

* They cannot have two consecutive dots `..` anywhere
* They cannot contain a `\`
* They cannot be the single character `@`
* They cannot begin or end with a slash `/`
* They cannot have question-mark `?`, asterisk `*`, or open bracket `[` anywhere
* They cannot have ASCII control characters (`\t`, `\n`), `space`, tilde `~`, caret `^`, or colon `:` anywhere

#### Make your changes

The whole point of creating a branch is to create a safe place to modify a specific portion of the code. With a `git branch` created, it is safe to edit your files, before proceeding with the remaining steps below.

#### Stage and commit your changes

As previously described, once you are satisifed with your changes, they must be staged and then committed.

```bash
$ git add johnny_appleseed.txt
$ git commit -m "added edits to johnny's history"
```

#### Merge your changes into the master branch

As noted above, `git checkout` allows you to change to an alternate branch. The `master` branch is created by default by Git and is often used as the main branch for release. To change back to the `master` branch, use `git checkout master`. Often others may be working on the same codebase and some of those changes may impact your codebase, so it is critical to collect all of those changes (i.e. download them from the `upstream` repository) for comparison to your code, using `git pull`.

For now, we will presume that there are no conflicts between your changes and other changes. With that premise in mind, you can merge your code and your local copy of the `upstream` repo.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git merge appleseed-feature
```

If you have any conflicts, you will need to address them. GitHub has a simple resource for [resolving conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/). A full discussion of conflict resolution is beyond the scope of this lesson.

#### Delete your feature branch

When you are finished using a branch (i.e. all the pertinent changes have been merged into master), you can simply delete it:

```bash
$ git branch -d appleseed-feature
```
