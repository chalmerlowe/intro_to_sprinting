# Pull Request Tips and Suggestions

## Time-box

3-5 Minutes

## Overview

When you submit a pull request the original project developer may:

* Accept your changes as is and do so immediately
* Accept your changes, but it may take an hour OR a year
* Respond back and ask that you refine your suggestion
* Respond back and provide guidance or clarification on what is really needed
* Respond back and let you know they won't be accepting the changes at all
    * Maybe the project is moving in a different direction OR 
    * changing technologies OR 
    * someone suggested a better, faster, cheaper solution
* Not respond back at all...

The world of open source is rich in personalities and capabilities. Some developers are great at communication and some are horrible. Don't be surprised don't let the response (or lack thereof) get you down.

As a participant in open source there are ways to improve the chance that our hard work will be understood, accepted and respected.

## What to do

* Be respectful
* Be helpful
* Be humble
* If you are working on a issue:
    * Examine the thread related to the issue very carefully
    * Communicate with the developer(s) in the issue thread about your proposed changes to confirm that you understand the problem AND to help set their minds at ease that you understand the problem.
    * Look for previous attempts to solve the problem OR discussions about what hasn't/won't work.
    * Outline any changes you intend to tackle so that others who might be working on the same problem at the same time can potentially collaborate OR avoid re-inventing the wheel.
* If you are working on a new feature OR making a correction that has not been tracked in the issues already, make a new issue and start the discussion to see if something in the development plan might override OR supercede your proposed changes.
