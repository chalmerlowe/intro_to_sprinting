## Time-box

15 Minutes


## Overview

Collaborating on sprints generally requires the use of software tools to truly be effective and efficient. For this workshop, we will focus on using Git, and there is follow-on material on setting up additional tooling you'll use for different kinds of projects.

### Objectives

* Download the tools
* Install the tools
* Test for successful installation
* Review the purpose of the tools

## What to do

### Step One: Download and Install Git

First check to see if Git is already installed on your computer.

Open a command prompt/terminal and type `git`

You'll see one of two things.

- **A whole bunch of text**, similar to the following which is a document explaining some of the most common Git commands. If you see this go ahead and navigate to the next step in the tutorial using the navigation links at the bottom of the page, because git is already installed.

```bash
$ git
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:
...
```

OR you might see this:

- **`git: Command not found.`** Don't panic, this is good! It means that you **are going to follow our instructions to install Git!** Keep reading.

1. Download the [Git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (**NOTE:** If you are unsure if you need the 32 or 64-bit version, you can [follow these steps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq))

3. Run the .exe file that you downloaded and follow the instructions.

1. Download the [Git installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Open the .dmg file that you downloaded. Run the installer inside and follow the instructions.

##### Alternately, install using homebrew

Many Mac users use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install programs.

```bash
$ brew install git
```

If you are running Linux, there is a good chance that you already have Git installed. If it isn't, install it by typing one of these commands into your command prompt.

**Red Hat-based** systems (Red Hat, Centos, Fedora) use:

```bash
$ sudo yum install git-all
```

**Debian-based** systems (Ubuntu, Debian) use:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install git-all
```

### Step Two: Confirm your Git install

In a command prompt type `git config`. If Git is installed properly, you will see text explaining some of the common configuration options for Git.

### Troubleshooting

Here's a list of error messages & how to fix them.

- `git config: Command not found.` This typically means you need to quit & relaunch your terminal. Every time you open a terminal window, it references a list of locations to look for installed programs across your computer. Sometimes, if you install a piece of software, the terminal's copy of that list doesn't get updated automagically. While there are several ways to update the terminal's references, one of the easiest is to simply close and re-open the terminal window. If that doesn't fix it, ask for help.

## Done with commands for now!

If you (if you're working in pairs, you and your partner) are done, then now you can put your green sticky up! This is how we know you're done with the commands.

## The big picture

### What is Git and why did we install it?

Git is a distributed version control system for managing files. It allows multiple people to work on collections of files (usually source code) and then easily *merge* others' work so everyone can have the most up to date version of the project. A later lesson will provide more details on Git.

* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): also called "The Git Book", Pro Git is the authoritative book on doing everything that Git can do. It can be read online and also downloaded in many formats so you can read it anywhere.
