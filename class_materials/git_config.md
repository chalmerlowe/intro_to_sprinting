# Setting up Git

## Time-box

5 Minutes


## Overview

When you contribute to a project, you'll want your name associated with your contributions. Git will automatically attach your name and email address to every commit you make, if you tell it how.


## What to do

Run the following commands on the command-line to set two global configurations: your name and your email address. Since you are not Johnny Appleseed, please change the commands accordingly.

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Johnny Appleseed"
$ git config --global user.email "johnny.appleseed@example.com"
```

## Done with commands for now!

If you (and your partner, if you're working in pairs) are done, then you can put your green sticky up! This is how we know you're done.

## The big picture

These are the two fundamental configurations needed to use Git.

**Note:** The `--global` option applies these settings to all Git projects on your machine  
* You only need to run this **once per computer**.  
* To change a setting, simply re-run the command.  
* To override these settings for a specific project (e.g., a work project versus a personal project), simply run the command while in that project directory, and leave out the `--global` option.

Later sections of the workshop will go into greater depth on using Git.

## Deep dive

Git is a command-line tool, and as such you will be doing a lot of typing when you work with it. There are many configurations that can be set for Git but they are outside the scope of this workshop.

Because Git is a command-line tool, if you need a primer for the command line, check out the [Learn the command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) course on Codecademy. If you just need a quick reference, check out the cheatsheets in **Resources** section below.
