# Instructor Preparation

## Time-box

N/A: these preparatory steps should be completed prior to the start of the course.


## Overview

This section is intended for the workshop **instructor**. It outlines what the instructor should do to successfully execute this workshop.

This workshop is intended to be as 'hands-on' as possible. While some lecture and demonstration is necessary, the focus is on having participants spend the majority of their time working on using the skills demonstrated. As such, the workshop focuses on the following:

* Short sections of lecture to elaborate on the what and the why
* Short demos to show participants what to do and what to expect
* Hands-on practice labs to enable participants to practice all the skills in a supportive environment
* Side-saddle mentoring and question answering
* Pair programming to enable participants to help each other
* We strongly recommend the teaching practices suggested by Software Carpentry, including: sticky notes, minute cards, one up/one down, using their own machines, collaborative note taking, pair programming, and the peak rule. For details on these, see this [Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/14-live/index.html) article.


## What to do

There are two ways to run this workshop... a short codeless format OR a longer version based on a coding project.

### Codeless Format:

The Codeless Format can generally be handled in ~2 hours and doesn't require any code writing, but does include some commandline usage and covers `git`, GitHub, etc.

* Fork and clone the repository we will be using for the workshop
* Log-in to GitHub (create a GitHub account if you don't have one already) and navigate to [chalmerlowe/intro_to_sprinting_codeless_project](https://github.com/chalmerlowe/intro_to_sprinting_codeless_project)
* Duplicate the project into a new project of your own (**do not** fork, you want a completely separate copy of the project)

### Coding Project Format:

The details of the Coding Project Format are still in the works. For Python-focused developers, a calculator-based project is under development that can be used to expand the workshop to a total of ~4 hours and allow the participants to learn more about Sprint experiences such as testing, continuous integration, code formatting, etc.

IF you wish to experiment with a Coding Project Format and don't already have one in mind, do the following:

* Fork and clone the repository we will be using for the workshop
* Log-in to GitHub (create a GitHub account if you don't have one already) and navigate to [seawolf42/python-rpncalc](https://github.com/seawolf42/python-rpncalc)
* Duplicate the project into a new project of your own (**do not** fork, you want a completely separate copy of the project)
* For more information specific to the `rpncalc` project, see the [Instructor ReadMe](https://github.com/seawolf42/python-rpncalc/blob/master/INTRO_TO_SPRINTING_USAGE.md)

### Other pre-workshop reminders

* Secure a location with a projector, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.
* Advertise the session and process registrations, waitlist, etc.
* Plan for food and beverages (the workshop is ~four hours in length)
* Set up an online collaboration where participants can share resources, ideas, etc. Etherpad
* Acquire supplies: post-it notes, pencils, markers, etc

### At the venue

* Set up the projector, tables, chairs
* Pick up any food/beverages
* Distribute post-it notes, pencils to each student

### Post workshop follow-up

* Thank the attendees for their participation
* Issue a post-workshop survey (i.e. using Surveymonkey.com OR Google forms)
* If you have suggestions OR found something that just doesn't work: submit an issue to the repo [Intro to Sprinting Workshop](https://github.com/chalmerlowe/intro_to_sprinting/issues/) OR
* Better yet, work with your students to have them submit a Pull Request with suggestions or improvements.
