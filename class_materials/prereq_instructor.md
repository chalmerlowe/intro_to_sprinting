# Instructor Preparation


## Time-box

N/A: these preparatory steps should be completed prior to the start of the course.


## Overview

This section is intended for the workshop **instructor**. It outlines what the instructor should do to successfully execute this workshop.

This workshop is intended to be as 'hands-on' as possible. While some lecture and demonstration is necessary, the focus is on having participants spend the majority of their time working on using the skills demonstrated. As such, the workshop focuses on the following

* Short sections of lecture to elaborate on the what and the why
* Short demos to show participants what to do and what to expect
* Hands-on practice labs to enable participants to practice all the skills in a supportive environment
* Side-saddle mentoring and question answering
* Pair programming to enable participants to help each other
* We strongly recommend the teaching practices suggested by Software Carpentry, including: sticky notes, minute cards, one up/one down, using their own machines, collaborative note taking, pair programming, and the peak rule. For details on these, see this [Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/15-practices/) article.


## What to do

### Fork and clone the repository we will be using for the workshop

* Duplicate the project into a new project of your own (**do not** fork, you want a completely separate copy of the project)
* For more information specific to the `rpncalc` project, see the [Instructor ReadMe](https://github.com/seawolf42/python-rpncalc/blob/master/INTRO_TO_SPRINTING_USAGE.md)

### Other pre-workshop reminders

* Secure a location with a projector, tables, chairs, whiteboard, etc.
* Advertise the session and process registrations, waitlist, etc.

### Post workshop follow-up
