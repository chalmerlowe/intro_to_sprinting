# Using Git
<!-- end auto-generated section -->


## Overview

Git is a version control system -- it enables you to control the various versions of your projects, such as open source projects.

While Git is great for helping you manage versions for **your own** projects, it also makes it easy to contribute to projects that **other people** are working on. If you are collaborating on a project with others OR if you have a copy of your project hosted somewhere, such as GitHub, the project code will live in a central **remote repository**, traditionally called `origin`. Programmers copy the project into their own **local repository**, where they can work on adding features and squashing bugs. When finished, they
push the code to `origin`, for other contributers to see and/or pull from. Version control systems, along with managing changes to projects, also help ensure each contributor is working on the same codebase.

## Objectives

Through participating in this session, attendees will be able to:

* Understand why Git is used in an open source project
* Use basic `git` commands to:
    * get a copy of an open source project
    * save modifications/additions/deletions to the project
    * submit those changes to the project
    * incorporate other's changes to the project
    * verify the status of the project repository
    * perform basic troubleshooting

**NOTE**: this will be a **hands-on** overview of `git`. It is incredibly powerful with many options and capabilities. The goal is to get you **started** with `git`, but it will take time and practice on your own to make you into an expert.


### Command-line interface

We will be using `git` from the command line in this course. There are a lot of commands, and they can be kind of confusing. That's OK... it will start to make sense once you do it a few times. And that's why you're here!

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)-based `git` tools

There are Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools available as well, but they are beyond the scope of this workshop. Some examples include:

* [gitk](https://lostechies.com/joshuaflanagan/2010/09/03/use-gitk-to-understand-git/)
* [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

... and there are many others.
