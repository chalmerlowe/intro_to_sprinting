# Installing `git`

Git can be installed many ways. However, it is important to install
git in the way that is most common for your operating system.

## Linux Distributions

For linux distributions use the package manager that comes with the
operating system. On Ubuntu the default package manager is `apt`.

``` shell
sudo apt install git
```

## OSX (macOS)

Many mac users have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed on thier machine for installing programs.

``` shell
brew install git
```
