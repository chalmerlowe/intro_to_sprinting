# intro_to_sprinting
This represents a high-level overview of the steps, tools and tradecraft needed to introduce beginners to open source sprints.

This overview will walk attendees through the following open source skillsets in both a discussion format AND a hands-on format.

* Understanding, creating, and using virtual environments
* Using version control tools such as git and github
* Hands-on: Creating additions and changes to an open source project
* Getting those changes incorporated into an open source project

In addition, the overview will include numerous resources for self-study.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)):

A sprint is a get-together of people involved in a project to further a focused development of the project. Sprints typically last from one week up to three weeks. Sprints have become popular events in some open-source projects. For example, the PyPy project is mostly developed during regularly held sprints where most of the international developer team gathers.

Sprints often take place near conferences which most of the project team attend, but they can also be hosted by some involved party at their premises or at some interesting location.

Sprints are organized around the ideas of the Extreme Programming discipline of software development. A coach directs the sprint, suggesting tasks, tracking their progress and making sure that no one remains stuck. Most of the development happens in pairs. A large open space is often chosen as a venue for efficient communication.

Sprints can vary in focus. During some sprints people new to the project are welcomed and get an intensive hands-on introduction pairing with an experienced project member. The first part of such sprints is usually spent getting ready, presenting the tutorials, getting the network setup and ensuring that configuration/source-control software and processes are installed and followed.

A significant benefit of sprinting is that the project members meet in person, socialize, and start to communicate more effectively than when working together remotely.
